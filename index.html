        <p class="body">
            Climate change is one of the biggest issues that came with the industrial age. With the Earth rapidly heating up, problems could get so bad, that the Arctic will have no ice!
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            People should stop releasing so much greenhouse gas. When this happens, the Earth's atmosphere traps in heat, slowly destroying the planet. I think we need to save the planet and make Earth a safe, healthy place for generations.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">Too Much Greenhouse Gas</h2>
        <p class="body">
            Humans have been burning fossil fuels since the end of the 1700s, creating greenhouse gases. These gases keep heat from escaping the atmosphere, heating the Earth. People will lose things they rely on to live, such as rainwater, or experience more natural disasters such as hurricanes. Caltech claims "...some of the long-term effects of global climate change in the United States include:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
<li>Continued temperature rise</li>
<li>A lengthened frost-free season (and growing season)</li>
<li>Changes in precipitation patterns</li>
<li>More droughts and heat waves</li>
<li>Stronger and more intense hurricanes</li>
<li>Sea level rise of 1â€“6.6 feet by 2100</li>
<li>An ice-free Arctic</li>
" (Caltech).
        </ul>
        <p class="body">
            Species are going extinct from climate change. The Bramble Cay melomys are a rodent that recently went extinct from climate change. They went extinct because rising sea levels destroyed their habitat. This might be the first species to go extinct from global warming. Another species is the golden toad, which went extinct directly because of the changing temperatures.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            While not many species have gone extinct from global warming yet, many of them are being impacted and are close to extinction. The Polar Bears' population is decreasing rapidly due to global warming melting arctic sea ice. The Green Sea Turtles' population is also decreasing, because the changing temperatures are causing most newly born turtles to be female, making it hard for The Green Sea Turtles to reproduce.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            It's not just animals that will be affected. It's people too. Poorer countries, that did not even add to climate change, will be affected the most. They will not have enough money to fight rising sea levels, and the water will flood their land. Farmers would lose their crops, which would take food from them, and the floods would damage buildings. Innocent people lose their lives and property.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">Climate Change Deniers</h2>
        <p class="body">Even though every climate scientist in the world says climate change is a real threat, some people still don't believe it. This is because they profit from climate change, or they have gotten misinformation.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            There is an entire organization, just to stop people from believing in climate change. They are funded by lots of organizations that benefit from climate change. Smithsonian Magazine states, "There is a very well-funded, well-orchestrated climate change-denial movement, one funded by powerful people with very deep pockets." (Colin Schultz).
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">How Can We Solve This?</h2>
        <p class="body">We need to stop this. To do that, we need to find cleaner ways to do things. For example, driving an electric car instead of gasoline, or even biking instead of driving at all. Items made of metal and plastic create CO2 emissions, so try not to buy too much of that. One of the most effective things we can do to stop global warming is use less electricity. Most of the electricity we use is made from coal, oil, and other fossil fuels. Even though some of the damage has already been done, we can still save the planet. MIT says "...if we act swiftly, it is not too late to prevent much more severe changes to the Earth's climate." (MIT).
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            Younger generations are more aware of climate change. They have grown up hearing about the effects of the Earth's heating and feel more strongly about it. Maybe today's children will stop climate change and save the planet.
